        <h2>Ganga River Pollution — Kanpur Case Study</h2>

      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        The Ganga River is one of India’s most sacred and economically significant rivers,
        yet it faces severe <b>water pollution</b> Kanpur, a major industrial city in Uttar Pradesh,
        contributes significantly to toxic discharge into the river.
      </p>

      <h3>Major Sources of Water Pollution</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Tannery Waste:</b> Release of untreated chromium-rich wastewater from leather tanneries.</li>
        <li><b>Sewage Discharge:</b> Large volumes of domestic sewage enter the river without treatment.</li>
        <li><b>Religious Waste:</b> Immersion of idols, flowers, and ashes adds organic and chemical pollutants.</li>
        <li><b>Agricultural Runoff:</b> Fertilizers and pesticides from surrounding farmlands flow into the river.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Water Quality Data</h3>
      <p>
        - BOD levels frequently exceed <b>50 mg/L</b> (safe standard is 3 mg/L). <br/>
        - Presence of <b>heavy metals like chromium and lead</b> is higher than permissible limits. <br/>
        - Coliform bacteria are alarmingly high due to sewage discharge.
      </p>

      <h3>Effects on Health & Environment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Increase in gastrointestinal and skin infections among nearby residents.</li>
        <li>Threat to aquatic life due to low dissolved oxygen.</li>
        <li>Contaminated water affecting agriculture and livestock.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Government & Community Measures</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Establishment of sewage treatment plants under the <b>Namami Gange</b> mission.</li>
        <li>Relocation and regulation of tanneries in the Kanpur region.</li>
        <li>Awareness programs to reduce religious waste dumping.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        Although various steps have been taken, pollution in the Ganga at Kanpur
        requires continuous <b>industrial regulation, waste management, and public involvement</b>
        to restore the river’s ecological balance.
