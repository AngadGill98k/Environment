      <h2>Bhopal Air Pollution Case Study</h2>

      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        Bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh, is historically remembered for the 
        <b> 1984 Bhopal Gas Tragedy</b> — one of the world’s worst industrial disasters. 
        While that was a one-time catastrophic event, today the city continues to battle 
        <b> chronic air pollution</b> due to urbanization, traffic, and industries.
      </p>

      <h3>Major Sources of Air Pollution</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Vehicular Emissions:</b> Rapid growth of two-wheelers, cars, and 
          auto-rickshaws running on petrol and diesel. Traffic congestion in central 
          areas increases exposure to toxic gases like NO₂, CO, and PM2.5.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Industrial Activity:</b> Chemical and small-scale manufacturing industries 
          release harmful gases. Brick kilns around the city also emit smoke and fine dust.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Construction Dust:</b> Ongoing urban development creates suspended dust (PM10). 
          Poorly managed road construction and unpaved roads worsen the situation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Waste Burning:</b> Burning of municipal waste and agricultural residues adds 
          particulate matter and toxic smoke.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Air Quality Data (Recent Trends)</h3>
      <p>
        - Average AQI in Bhopal often ranges from <b>150 to 250</b> during winter, 
        which is considered “Unhealthy”.  
        - Major pollutants are <b>PM2.5</b>, <b>PM10</b>, and <b>NO₂</b>.  
        - Residential areas close to traffic intersections show higher pollutant concentrations.
      </p>

      <h3>Effects on Health</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Increased cases of asthma, bronchitis, and other respiratory diseases.</li>
        <li>Eye irritation, headaches, and skin allergies.</li>
        <li>Long-term exposure linked to cardiovascular problems.</li>
        <li>Children and elderly are most vulnerable.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Government & Community Measures</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Promotion of <b>CNG and electric vehicles</b> in public transport.</li>
        <li>Introduction of <b>odd-even traffic policies</b> on high AQI days.</li>
        <li>Expansion of green belts and roadside plantations.</li>
        <li>Awareness campaigns on avoiding waste burning.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        Bhopal’s air pollution is a growing environmental and health concern. While 
        the city’s history reminds the world of the dangers of industrial negligence, 
        its present scenario emphasizes the need for <b>clean transport, stricter 
        regulations, and community participation</b> to reduce pollution levels.
