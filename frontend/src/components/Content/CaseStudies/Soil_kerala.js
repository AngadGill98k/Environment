        <h2>E-Waste and Soil Contamination — Bengaluru Case Study</h2>

      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        Bengaluru, India’s tech hub, generates a massive quantity of <b>electronic waste</b>.
        Informal recycling and dumping have led to hazardous chemicals seeping into soil.
      </p>

      <h3>Major Pollutants</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Lead, Cadmium & Mercury:</b> Released from batteries, screens, and circuit boards.</li>
        <li><b>Brominated flame retardants:</b> From cables and plastic casings.</li>
        <li><b>Acidic residues:</b> From unregulated metal recovery processes.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Consequences</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Soil toxicity causing reduced plant growth in affected areas.</li>
        <li>Groundwater contamination due to heavy metal leaching.</li>
        <li>Health hazards for workers — cancer risk, neurological disorders, miscarriages.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Management & Solutions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Creation of authorized e-waste recycling facilities.</li>
        <li>Ban on burning and acid-based informal processing.</li>
        <li>Awareness programs on safe disposal of electronics.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        E-waste pollution in Bengaluru highlights the urgent need for <b>formal recycling,
        public awareness, and strict environmental enforcement</b> to reduce soil contamination.
