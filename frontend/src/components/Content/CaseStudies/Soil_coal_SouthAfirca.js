        <h2>Soil Pollution — Agricultural Fields of Punjab</h2>

      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        Punjab is one of India’s leading agricultural states, but intensive farming practices
        over decades have resulted in severe <b>soil pollution and nutrient depletion</b>.
      </p>

      <h3>Main Causes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Excessive Fertilizer Use:</b> High nitrate accumulation in soil.</li>
        <li><b>Pesticides:</b> Persistent chemicals like DDT and organophosphates remain for years.</li>
        <li><b>Stubble Burning:</b> Reduces soil fertility and increases toxic residues.</li>
        <li><b>Heavy Irrigation:</b> Causes salinity and alkalinity issues in soil.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Effects</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Decline in crop productivity and soil biodiversity.</li>
        <li>Farmers suffer from skin and respiratory disorders due to chemical exposure.</li>
        <li>Contaminants enter the food chain, affecting consumers nationwide.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Solutions Implemented</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Promotion of organic farming and biofertilizers.</li>
        <li>Government subsidies for residue-management machinery to reduce stubble burning.</li>
        <li>Soil health cards to monitor nutrient levels.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        Sustainable agricultural practices are critical for restoring soil quality
        and ensuring long-term food security in Punjab.
