      <h2>Taj Mahal Discoloration (Agra, Uttar Pradesh)</h2>

      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        The Taj Mahal, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the Seven Wonders 
        of the World, has been facing severe discoloration of its pristine white 
        marble. Once known for its glowing white appearance, the monument now 
        shows signs of <b>yellowing, browning, and even greenish patches</b> 
        due to air pollution and environmental stress.
      </p>

      <h3>Causes of Discoloration</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Industrial Emissions:</b> Foundries, chemical factories, and oil 
          refineries around Agra emit sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and nitrogen oxides 
          (NOₓ). These react with moisture to form <b>acid rain</b>, which corrodes 
          marble surfaces.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Vehicular Pollution:</b> Exhaust from thousands of vehicles in Agra 
          contributes to high levels of <b>PM2.5 and PM10</b>, which settle on 
          the monument and cause surface darkening.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Yamuna River Pollution:</b> Stagnant and polluted water in the Yamuna 
          promotes the growth of <b>insects and algae</b>. Their droppings leave 
          greenish-black stains on the marble.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM):</b> Fine carbon particles from 
          burning of fossil fuels and biomass settle on the surface, dulling the shine.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Dust & Urbanization:</b> Continuous construction activities in and 
          around Agra generate dust that sticks to the monument.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Effects</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Loss of aesthetic beauty of the Taj Mahal.</li>
        <li>Structural weakening due to acid rain corrosion.</li>
        <li>Tourism impact — reduced visitor satisfaction and global concern.</li>
        <li>Cultural heritage degradation and risk to India’s historical pride.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Control Measures Taken</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Establishment of the <b>Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ)</b> — a 10,400 sq. km 
          eco-sensitive area around the Taj Mahal to restrict polluting industries.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Ban on coal-based industries</b> and introduction of cleaner fuels like CNG.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Vehicular restrictions</b> — only electric or battery-operated vehicles 
          are allowed near the Taj Mahal.
        </li>
        <li>
          Regular <b>mud-pack treatment (Fuller’s Earth)</b> by ASI to clean and 
          restore the marble surface.
        </li>
        <li>
          Efforts to clean and revive the <b>Yamuna River</b> to reduce insect breeding.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        The Taj Mahal’s discoloration is a reminder of how <b>air and water 
        pollution threaten cultural heritage</b>. While several measures have been 
        introduced, long-term preservation requires strict enforcement of pollution 
        controls, cleaner industrial practices, eco-friendly transport, and 
        <b>community awareness</b> to protect this symbol of India’s history and pride.
