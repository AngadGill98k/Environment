         <h2>Yamuna River Pollution — Delhi Case Study</h2>

      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        The Yamuna is the lifeline of Delhi, but almost <b>70% of its length within Delhi is considered “dead”</b>
        due to extreme pollution. The river no longer supports aquatic life across major stretches.
      </p>

      <h3>Main Contributors</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Domestic Sewage:</b> Around 80% of Yamuna pollution in Delhi comes from untreated sewage.</li>
        <li><b>Industrial Effluents:</b> Chemical wastewater from dyeing units, battery industries, and electroplating.</li>
        <li><b>Foam Formation:</b> High phosphate levels from detergents lead to toxic white foam.</li>
        <li><b>Solid Waste:</b> Dumping of plastic, idol residues, and garbage along the riverbanks.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Impact</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Loss of aquatic organisms — minimal dissolved oxygen in most stretches.</li>
        <li>Bad odor and mosquito breeding affecting nearby residential areas.</li>
        <li>Increased risk of typhoid, dysentery, and cholera for people using the water.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Restoration Efforts</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Expansion of sewage treatment plants and interceptor drains.</li>
        <li>Strict regulation of industrial discharge.</li>
        <li>Ban on detergents containing excessive phosphates.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        Proper wastewater treatment and strict enforcement of environmental laws
        are essential to rejuvenate the Yamuna and protect public health in Delhi.
